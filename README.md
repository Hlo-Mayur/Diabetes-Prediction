# Diabetes Prediction 🩺

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual has diabetes using machine learning techniques applied to medical and physiological data. Early prediction of diabetes can help in timely diagnosis and preventive healthcare decision-making.

The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires early detection to reduce health risks and complications. The objective of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model that can classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on key medical attributes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains patient health records with multiple numerical features, including:
- Glucose level  
- Blood pressure  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Insulin level  
- Age  
- Pregnancies count  

The target variable indicates whether the patient is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0).
